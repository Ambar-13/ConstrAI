Inverse Effect Algebra (T7 Realization)
========================================

This module provides the machinery to automatically compute and apply
inverse effects, enabling proper rollback and undo semantics.

Key theorem (T7): For every action a and state s, there exists an inverse
action a_inv such that:
    a_inv.simulate(a.simulate(s)) == s

This is essential for:
  1. True rollback (not just identity semantics)
  2. Recovery from bad states
  3. Compositional reasoning about state reversibility
