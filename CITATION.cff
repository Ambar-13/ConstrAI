description: >-
  A formal safety framework for AI agents that enforces mathematical
  invariants through state-transition simulation rather than prompt-based
  guardrails. Provides eight proven safety theorems (T1-T8: budget safety,
  termination, invariant preservation, monotone resources, atomicity, trace
  integrity, rollback exactness, and emergency override) enforced by a
  non-bypassable safety kernel. Ships with 25 pre-built invariant factories,
  LLM adapters for Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenClaw, LangChain, LangGraph, FastAPI,
  and MCP, and a clampai.testing module for writing safety property tests.
  Evaluated against 39 adversarial attack scenarios across 9 threat categories
  with 89.7% recall and zero false positives at sub-millisecond latency
  (45,000+ checks/sec). Zero runtime dependencies.
